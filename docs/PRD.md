# Figma to Coda Pack - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary

The Figma to Coda Pack is a comprehensive integration that connects Figma design systems directly to Coda workspaces through OAuth2 authentication. This pack enables design teams to sync components, styles, variables, and dev resources from Figma into Coda tables for enhanced project management, documentation, and cross-functional collaboration.

## Problem Statement

**Current Challenge**: Design teams using Figma lack seamless integration with Coda for project management and documentation. Existing solutions require manual data entry or use indirect authentication methods that limit functionality and user adoption.

**Target Users**:
- Design teams managing component libraries
- Product managers tracking design system usage
- Developers needing design token and component information
- Cross-functional teams requiring design asset visibility

## Goals & Success Metrics

### Primary Goals
1. **Seamless Authentication**: Direct OAuth2 integration with Figma eliminates authentication friction
2. **Real-time Data Sync**: Automatic synchronization of Figma components, styles, and variables
3. **Enhanced Collaboration**: Bridge design and project management workflows
4. **Enterprise Support**: Full support for Figma Enterprise features (variables, dev resources)

### Success Metrics
- OAuth authentication success rate > 95%
- Sync performance < 30 seconds for teams with 1000+ components
- User adoption rate > 80% within 30 days of deployment
- Zero manual data entry required for design system documentation

### Advanced Use Cases (Enterprise)

**Variable Management:**
- Sync design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) as structured data
- Track variable usage across multiple files
- Maintain design token documentation

**Dev Resources Integration:**
- **Production Status Tracking**: Link component sets to Coda production tracking rows with automatic status synchronization

- **Implementation Links**: Connect components to GitHub PRs, Storybook stories, and documentation URLs
- **Team Visibility**: All stakeholders see current implementation status (Not Started → In Progress → Completed)
- **Context Switching Reduction**: Access all relevant links and status directly from Figma Dev Mode
- **Audit Trail**: Track when components move through production stages with timestamps and assignees

**Design Workspace Management:**
- Maintain a complete inventory of all design projects and their status
- Track file organization and identify files that need archiving
- Monitor page structures to ensure teams follow naming conventions
- Create cross-project visibility for design system adoption metrics
