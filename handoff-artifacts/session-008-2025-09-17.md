# Session 008 - 2025-09-17: Projects API Implementation & Documentation Updates

## Session Overview
**Objective**: Implement Figma Projects API support and update project documentation
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Pack Version**: Upgraded from v8 to v9
**Phase**: Phase 3 - Complete Feature Set (90% ‚Üí 95% complete)

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Figma Projects API Implementation ‚úÖ
- **Added OAuth Scope**: Extended from `["file_read"]` to `["file_read", "projects:read"]`
- **Created New Schemas**:
  - `ProjectsSchema`: Project metadata with ID, name, team ID, file count, timestamps
  - `ProjectFilesSchema`: File metadata with thumbnails, project context, branch data
- **Implemented Sync Tables**:
  - `TeamProjects`: Lists all projects from a Figma team
  - `ProjectFiles`: Lists all files from a specific project with optional branch data

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- **403 Error Guidance**: Specific messages about Projects API requiring approval
- **404 Error Handling**: Clear guidance for invalid project IDs
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Explains how to get required IDs from other sync tables
- **Scope Validation**: Alerts about missing `projects:read` OAuth scope

### 3. Documentation Overhaul
- **Updated CLAUDE.md**: Refreshed from outdated MVP phase to current Phase 3 state
- **Added PRD Enhancements**: Incorporated organizational use cases and API endpoints
- **Progress Tracking**: Updated completion from 85% to 90% and then to 95%

### 4. Pack Deployment
- **Version 9 Upload**: Successfully uploaded with comprehensive version notes
- **Validation**: All builds and validations passing
- **OAuth Update**: New scope requires re-authentication for existing users

## Technical Implementation Details

### New API Endpoints Integrated
```
GET /v1/teams/{team_id}/projects - Team project listings
GET /v1/projects/{project_id}/files - Project file inventory
```

### Schema Design Highlights
- **Hierarchical Relationships**: Projects ‚Üí Files ‚Üí Components/Styles
- **Comprehensive Metadata**: Timestamps, thumbnails, user context
- **Direct Links**: Generated Figma URLs for all entities
- **Optional Features**: Branch data support for advanced workflows

### Code Organization
- **Single-File Architecture**: Maintained for Phase 3 (src/index.ts - now ~985 lines)
- **Schema Placement**: Added after existing schemas, before sync tables
- **Consistent Patterns**: Followed established error handling and URL parsing
- **Future-Ready**: Prepared for potential modular restructuring

## User Impact & Value

### New Capabilities Enabled
1. **Design Operations Managers** can now:
   - View complete organizational project structure
   - Track file distribution across projects
   - Generate project-level reports
   - Monitor workspace organization

2. **Design Leads** can now:
   - Understand project scope and file relationships
   - Track organizational structure in Coda
   - Create documentation mapping Figma structure to roadmaps

### Workflow Integration
- **Two-Step Process**: Use TeamProjects to get project IDs, then use ProjectFiles
- **Cross-Reference**: Project files can link to existing component/style sync tables
- **Data Relationships**: Full traceability from team ‚Üí project ‚Üí file ‚Üí components

## Testing & Validation

### Completed Tests ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Pack builds successfully
- ‚úÖ Pack validates without errors
- ‚úÖ Upload to Coda successful (Version 9)
- ‚úÖ Schema definitions correct
- ‚úÖ Error handling comprehensive

### Pending Real-World Tests üîÑ
- üîÑ OAuth flow with `projects:read` scope
- üîÑ TeamProjects sync with real team data
- üîÑ ProjectFiles sync with real project IDs
- üîÑ Error handling with invalid inputs
- üîÑ Projects API approval status verification

## Known Limitations & Considerations

### Projects API Restrictions
- **Limited Access**: API requires approval from Figma for some use cases
- **No Pagination**: Projects endpoints don't document pagination support
- **Approval Required**: May need special permissions for organizational access

### User Experience Notes
- **OAuth Re-authentication**: Users need to reconnect with new scope
- **Sequential Workflow**: Must use TeamProjects first to get project IDs
- **Error Guidance**: Clear messaging about API limitations and access requirements

## Updated Project Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- **Pack Size**: ~985 lines (up from 732)
- **Sync Tables**: 6 total (2 organizational + 4 design assets)
- **Schemas**: 5 comprehensive schemas
- **API Endpoints**: 8 endpoints covered (6 implemented + 2 planned)
- **Build Success**: 100%
- **Upload Success**: Version 9 deployed

### Feature Completion
- **Phase 3 Progress**: 90% ‚Üí 95% complete
- **Organizational Features**: 100% implemented
- **Design Asset Features**: 100% implemented
- **Enterprise Features**: 0% (Variables/Dev Resources planned for Phase 4)

## Next Session Priorities

### HIGH Priority
1. **Real-World Testing**: Test new sync tables with actual Figma data
2. **OAuth Verification**: Confirm `projects:read` scope works correctly
3. **Error Validation**: Test API limitations and approval requirements

### MEDIUM Priority
1. **Card Formulas**: Individual component/style/project card formulas
2. **Performance Testing**: Large dataset handling for projects/files
3. **User Documentation**: Create usage examples and workflows

### LOW Priority
1. **Phase 4 Planning**: Variables and Dev Resources implementation
2. **Modular Architecture**: Consider file structure reorganization
3. **Advanced Features**: Image export, webhook integration planning

## Architectural Decisions Made

### Decision: Maintain Single-File Architecture
- **Rationale**: Current implementation working well, premature to modularize
- **Future**: May revisit when approaching 1500+ lines or Phase 4
- **Benefits**: Easier maintenance, deployment, and debugging

### Decision: Projects API Error Strategy
- **Approach**: Comprehensive error messages with specific guidance
- **Rationale**: API has limited access and complex approval requirements
- **Implementation**: Multi-level error handling with user education

### Decision: Schema Design Philosophy
- **Pattern**: Separate organizational and design asset schemas
- **Benefits**: Clear separation of concerns, easier to understand
- **Consistency**: Follows existing patterns while adding new capabilities

## Session Reflection

- **Documentation Currency**: Regular updates crucial for AI handoff quality
- **Error Messaging**: Invest in comprehensive user guidance for complex APIs

## Post-Session Discovery: Projects API Blocker

### Issue Discovered
After implementation completion, testing revealed that Figma's Projects API requires special approval that we do not currently have:

**Error Details**:
- Endpoint: `https://api.figma.com/v1/teams/{team_id}/projects`
- Response: 404 "Not found"
- Cause: Projects API is restricted and requires Figma approval

### Action Taken
**API Access Request Submitted (2025-09-17)**:
- Email: chris@epicosity.com
- Client ID: [CLIENT_ID_REDACTED]
- App Name: Epic Figma to Coda
- Use Case: Agency workflow integration for design system management
- Status: Under review by Figma

### Impact Assessment
- **TeamProjects Sync Table**: Implemented but blocked until approval
- **ProjectFiles Sync Table**: Implemented but blocked until approval
- **Phase 3 Progress**: Reduced from 95% to 90% (5% blocked)
- **Alternative Focus**: Shift to Card formulas and existing sync table optimization
