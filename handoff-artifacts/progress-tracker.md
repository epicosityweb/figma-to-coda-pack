### ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Issue (Session 12 Priority)
**Formula Autocomplete Problem**: Dev resource formulas not appearing in Coda autocomplete despite Version 15 deployment
- Pack shows correct version (v15) in Coda doc
- All 11 formulas confirmed present in codebase
- Fresh deployment completed successfully
- Issue may be Coda UI caching or refresh problem
- **Next Session**: Test direct formula usage and investigate Coda pack refresh options

### Next Session Priorities (Formula Availability Resolution)
1. **CRITICAL**: Test direct formula usage without autocomplete in Coda
2. **HIGH**: Investigate Coda pack refresh/reinstall options
3. **HIGH**: Validate end-to-end component-aware workflows once formulas are available
4. **MEDIUM**: Contact Coda support if autocomplete issue persists
5. **LOW**: Document workarounds and alternative button-based approaches
