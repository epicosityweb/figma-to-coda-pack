## Notes & Observations

### Key Decisions Made
- Decided to use iterative MVP approach starting with OAuth validation
- Established comprehensive handoff documentation system
- Prioritized authentication validation before feature implementation

### Lessons Learned
- Comprehensive planning phase reduces development risk
- Handoff documentation system critical for AI conversation continuity
- MVP approach allows for quick validation of core assumptions
