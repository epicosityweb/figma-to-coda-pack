# Session 001 - 2025-01-17

## Session Goal
Create a comprehensive PRD and working MVP for Figma to Coda Pack with OAuth2 authentication validation.

## Participants
- AI Assistant: Claude Opus 4.1
- Human: Project lead with Figma Teams super admin access

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed existing Figma Design Integration pack source code
- [x] Created comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD)
- [x] Established structured handoff documentation system
- [x] Initialized complete project structure
- [x] Created MVP pack with OAuth2 authentication
- [x] Set up package.json and TypeScript configuration
- [x] Successfully validated and built the pack
- [x] Created README with setup instructions
- [x] Documented session handoff artifacts

## Code Changes

### Files Created
- `docs/PRD.md` - Comprehensive Product Requirements Document
- `handoff-artifacts/README.md` - Documentation templates and guidelines
- `handoff-artifacts/progress-tracker.md` - Project progress tracking
- `handoff-artifacts/decisions-log.md` - Technical and product decisions
- `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and build scripts
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules
- `src/index.ts` - MVP pack implementation with OAuth2
- `README.md` - Project overview and setup instructions

### Files Modified
- None (initial creation session)

### Files Deleted
- None

## Key Decisions Made

1. **MVP-First Development Approach**
   - **Rationale**: Validate OAuth and deployment before building full feature set
   - **Impact**: Reduces risk and enables iterative development

2. **Comprehensive Handoff Documentation System**
   - **Rationale**: Ensure continuity across AI conversations
   - **Impact**: Better project tracking and knowledge preservation

3. **Direct OAuth2 Implementation**
   - **Rationale**: Better UX than personal access tokens, supports team permissions
   - **Impact**: Requires OAuth app registration but provides superior experience

4. **TypeScript + Modular Architecture**
   - **Rationale**: Type safety and maintainability
   - **Impact**: Robust codebase foundation for iterative development

## Testing Results

### What was tested
- Pack validation using `npx coda validate src/index.ts` ✅
- Pack build using `npx coda build src/index.ts` ✅
- TypeScript compilation (with minor SDK compatibility issues)
- npm dependency installation ✅

### Issues discovered
- **TypeScript SDK Compatibility**: Minor type definition issues in SDK v1.8.0
  - **Severity**: Low (doesn't affect pack functionality)
  - **Resolution**: Coda CLI validation and build work correctly

## Known Issues
- TypeScript compilation shows warnings from SDK type definitions (cosmetic only)
- OAuth app registration with Figma still required before live testing
- Pack ID configuration needed for actual upload to Coda

## Next Session Priorities

1. **HIGH**: Register OAuth application with Figma
   - Create OAuth app in Figma developer settings
   - Configure redirect URLs for Coda pack
   - Obtain client ID and secret

2. **HIGH**: Upload and test MVP pack in Coda
   - Configure pack ID in package.json
   - Upload pack to Coda workspace
   - Test OAuth connection flow end-to-end

3. **MEDIUM**: Validate test formulas with real Figma data
   - Test `TestConnection()` formula
   - Test `TestTeamAccess()` with actual team URL
   - Verify error handling works correctly

4. **LOW**: Begin planning Phase 2 implementation
   - Design component schema structure
   - Plan first sync table implementation

## Important Context for Next AI

### Critical information to remember
- User has Figma Teams account with super admin access
- MVP focuses on OAuth validation only - no full features yet
- Project uses structured session documentation for AI handoffs
- Iterative development approach with clear phases

### Current state summary
- **Where we left off**: Complete MVP pack that validates and builds successfully
- **What's working**: Pack structure, OAuth configuration, test formulas, build process
- **What needs attention**: OAuth app registration, live deployment testing

### MVP Features Implemented
- OAuth2 authentication configuration for Figma
- `TestConnection()` formula to verify OAuth and get user info
- `TestTeamAccess()` formula to verify API access with team URLs
- Proper error handling with user-friendly messages
- Complete project structure ready for expansion

### File Structure Overview
```
figma-coda-pack/
├── docs/PRD.md (comprehensive requirements)
├── handoff-artifacts/ (session documentation)
├── src/index.ts (MVP pack implementation)
├── package.json & tsconfig.json (build configuration)
└── README.md (setup instructions)
```

## Additional Notes

### Build Commands Verified
- `npm install` - Dependencies installed successfully
- `npx coda validate src/index.ts` - Pack validates without errors
- `npx coda build src/index.ts` - Pack builds successfully

### OAuth Endpoints Configured
- Authorization URL: `https://www.figma.com/oauth`
- Token URL: `https://www.figma.com/api/oauth/token`
- Scope: `file_read` (expandable for future features)

### Success Criteria for Next Session
- OAuth app registered with Figma
- Pack uploaded to Coda successfully
- Connection flow works end-to-end
- Test formulas return real data

**Session Duration**: ~90 minutes
**Next Session Target**: OAuth registration and live deployment testing
**Project Status**: MVP ready for deployment testing (Phase 1: 75% complete)
