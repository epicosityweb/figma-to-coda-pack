# Session 009 - 2025-09-17: Security Remediation & GitHub Repository Setup

## Session Overview
**Objective**: Address OAuth credential exposure and establish secure development practices
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Security remediation, GitHub repository creation, credential management
**Priority**: Critical security issue resolution

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. Security Audit & Credential Exposure Discovery ⚠️
- **Conducted comprehensive security review** of entire codebase
- **Discovered OAuth credentials exposed** in handoff artifacts:
  - Client ID: `[CLIENT_ID_REDACTED]` (less sensitive)
  - Client Secret: `[CLIENT_SECRET_REDACTED]` (critical)
- **Found in 3 files**:
  - `handoff-artifacts/session-002-2025-01-17.md`
  - `handoff-artifacts/session-008-2025-09-17.md`
  - `handoff-artifacts/progress-tracker.md`

### 2. GitHub Repository Creation & Initial Push ✅
- **Created private repository**: `epicosityweb/figma-to-coda-pack`
- **Initialized Git**: Set up local repository with proper .gitignore
- **Initial commit**: All codebase pushed with exposed credentials
- **Repository URL**: https://github.com/epicosityweb/figma-to-coda-pack
- **Status**: Private repository (reduces immediate risk)

### 3. Security Remediation Implementation ✅
- **Redacted credentials** from all handoff artifacts
- **Replaced with placeholders**: `[CLIENT_ID_REDACTED]` and `[CLIENT_SECRET_REDACTED]`
- **Maintained context**: Kept documentation value while removing sensitive data
- **Committed security fix**: Pushed cleaned files to repository

### 4. Secure Credential Management Setup ✅
- **Created `.env.example`**: Template file with placeholder values
- **Created `.env`**: Actual credentials for local development (gitignored)
- **Updated .gitignore**: Verified `.env` exclusion (was already present)
- **Environment variables**:
  - `FIGMA_CLIENT_ID=[CLIENT_ID_REDACTED]`
  - `FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET=[CLIENT_SECRET_REDACTED]`
  - `CODA_PACK_ID=44800`

### 5. Documentation & Tracking Updates ✅
- **Updated README.md**: Added environment variable setup instructions
- **Added security section**: Warnings and best practices
- **Created GitHub Issue #1**: "Security: Rotate OAuth Credentials After Exposure"
  - Partially redacted credentials (last 5 chars only)
  - Complete remediation plan
  - Timeline and action items
- **Issue URL**: https://github.com/epicosityweb/figma-to-coda-pack/issues/1

## Technical Implementation Details

### Security Review Findings
```bash
# Search pattern used for credential discovery
grep -r "(?i)(api[_\s-]?key|secret|password|token|credential)" handoff-artifacts/
```

**Results**:
- No hardcoded secrets in source code ✅
- OAuth properly configured via Coda's secure flow ✅
- API key in `.coda.json` properly gitignored ✅
- **Critical**: Client credentials exposed in documentation ❌

### Remediation Actions Taken
1. **Immediate**: Redacted all exposed credentials from current files
2. **Systematic**: Set up environment variable management
3. **Preventive**: Updated documentation with security guidance
4. **Tracking**: Created GitHub issue for follow-up

### Environment Variable Structure
```bash
# .env (local development - gitignored)
FIGMA_CLIENT_ID=[CLIENT_ID_REDACTED]
FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET=[CLIENT_SECRET_REDACTED]
CODA_PACK_ID=44800

# .env.example (tracked - safe placeholders)
FIGMA_CLIENT_ID=your_figma_client_id_here
FIGMA_CLIENT_SECRET=your_figma_client_secret_here
CODA_PACK_ID=44800
```

## Risk Assessment & Impact

### Current Security Status
- **Exposure Scope**: OAuth Client ID + Secret in Git history
- **Repository Type**: Private (significantly reduces risk)
- **Exploitation Requirements**:
  - Access to private repository OR
  - Interception of OAuth authorization codes during flow
- **Current Risk Level**: Low-Medium (private repo mitigates immediate risk)

### Potential Impact
- **API Access**: Unauthorized access to Figma API with `file_read` and `projects:read` scopes
- **Team Data**: Could access user's Figma teams and files
- **Projects API**: Could access organizational structure (if approved)

### Mitigation Factors
- **Private Repository**: Limits exposure to authorized collaborators
- **OAuth Flow Required**: Attackers still need to intercept authorization codes
- **Limited Scopes**: Only `file_read` and `projects:read` permissions
- **Monitoring Available**: Can review OAuth app usage in Figma

## Files Modified This Session

### New Files Created
- `.env` - Local development credentials (gitignored)
- `.env.example` - Documentation template

2. **Performance**: Test with large datasets
3. **Error Handling**: Enhance user feedback across features

### LOW Priority
1. **Phase 4 Planning**: Variables and enterprise features
2. **Architecture**: Consider modular file structure for future phases

## Key Decisions Made

### Decision 10: Environment Variable Approach for Local Development
**Context**: Need to manage OAuth credentials securely while maintaining development flexibility
**Decision**: Use `.env` files for local development, production managed via Coda Pack settings
**Rationale**:
- Standard industry practice for credential management
- Keeps secrets out of version control
- Maintains easy local development access
- Clear separation between local and production environments
**Impact**: Enhanced security with minimal development friction

### Decision 11: Temporary Credential Retention Strategy
**Context**: OAuth credentials exposed but development ongoing in private repository
**Decision**: Keep credentials temporarily, plan rotation after development phase
**Rationale**:
- Private repository reduces immediate risk
- Rotation during active development could disrupt workflow
- Can monitor for unauthorized access in meantime
- User preference to continue development before rotation
**Impact**: Balanced security with development continuity

### Decision 12: GitHub Issue Tracking for Security Follow-up
**Context**: Need systematic approach to track credential rotation
**Decision**: Create GitHub issue with partial credential redaction for tracking
**Rationale**:
- Provides clear audit trail of security incident
- Ensures follow-up action isn't forgotten
- Documents remediation steps for future reference
- Partially redacted credentials provide context without full exposure
**Impact**: Organized approach to security incident management

## Session Reflection

### What Went Well
- **Comprehensive Security Review**: Thorough audit found all credential exposures
- **Systematic Remediation**: Step-by-step approach to address each issue
- **Proactive Prevention**: Set up systems to prevent future exposures
