# Session 003 - 2025-01-17

## Session Goal
Resolve OAuth configuration error and complete Phase 1 MVP authentication validation.

## Participants
- AI Assistant: Claude Opus 4.1
- Human: Project lead with Figma Teams super admin access and working OAuth credentials

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Investigated OAuth 404 token exchange errors
- [x] Analyzed both www.figma.com and api.figma.com token endpoints
- [x] Verified Figma OAuth app configuration was correct
- [x] Discovered missing /v1 path in token URL from official documentation
- [x] Fixed OAuth token URL to correct endpoint
- [x] Re-uploaded pack as version 4 with corrected configuration
- [x] Successfully tested OAuth flow end-to-end
- [x] Verified GetConnectionName function works with live data
- [x] Updated handoff documentation

## Code Changes

### Files Created
- `handoff-artifacts/session-003-2025-01-17.md` - This session documentation

### Files Modified
- `src/index.ts` - Fixed OAuth token URL from `https://www.figma.com/api/oauth/token` to `https://api.figma.com/v1/oauth/token`

### Files Deleted
- None

## Key Decisions Made

1. **OAuth Token URL Investigation**
   - **Rationale**: Both attempted token URLs returned 404 errors
   - **Impact**: Systematic debugging approach led to discovering documentation discrepancy
   - **Resolution**: Found official Figma docs specified `/v1` path requirement

2. **Pack Version Management**
   - **Rationale**: Multiple iterations needed to test different OAuth configurations
   - **Impact**: Pack progressed through versions 1-4 during troubleshooting
   - **Resolution**: Version 4 contains working OAuth configuration

## OAuth Resolution Details

### Root Cause Analysis
The OAuth flow was failing with 404 errors on token exchange. Investigation revealed:
- Authorization flow initiated successfully
- Token exchange consistently failed with "Not Found" errors
- Both `www.figma.com` and `api.figma.com` domains were tested
- Figma app configuration was verified as correct

### Critical Discovery
Official Figma OAuth documentation specified the token endpoint as:
`https://api.figma.com/v1/oauth/token`

Our implementation was missing the `/v1` path component.

### Solution Implementation
```typescript
// Before (failed)
tokenUrl: "https://www.figma.com/api/oauth/token"

// After (working)
tokenUrl: "https://api.figma.com/v1/oauth/token"
```

## Testing Results

### OAuth Flow Success ✅
- Authorization initiated: `Path: /frontendAuth/packs/oauth2/44800/begin`
- Token exchange succeeded: `POST https://api.figma.com/v1/oauth/token` → 200 OK
- Connection established: ID `8bc9c2ef-b234-41d8-8542-6accc9beb682`
- GetConnectionName executed: `GET https://api.figma.com/v1/me` → 200 OK (335ms)

### What was tested
- OAuth authorization flow ✅
- Token exchange with correct endpoint ✅
- GetConnectionName function with live user data ✅
- Pack installation and connection in Coda document ✅

### Ready for Testing
- `TestConnection()` formula - Ready to return live user data
- `TestTeamAccess("team-url")` formula - Ready to test team API access
- Full OAuth authentication cycle confirmed working

## Current Status

### What's Working
- Complete OAuth2 authentication flow
- Figma API authentication and user data retrieval
- Pack validation and deployment pipeline
- Structured handoff documentation system

### Phase 1 MVP: COMPLETE ✅
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] Package.json and TypeScript configuration
- [x] Basic pack structure with OAuth2
- [x] Test formulas for authentication validation
- [x] Local build and deployment process
- [x] OAuth app registration with Figma
- [x] Pack creation and upload to Coda (Pack ID: 44800)
- [x] OAuth credentials configured in both systems
- [x] OAuth flow validation and testing

### What's Ready for Next Session
- TestConnection() and TestTeamAccess() formulas ready for real-world testing
- Foundation prepared for Phase 2: Core Sync Tables
- Clear path to component schema implementation

## Next Session Priorities

1. **HIGH**: Test MVP formulas with real data
   - Execute TestConnection() and verify user data structure
   - Test TestTeamAccess() with actual Figma team URL
   - Document API response formats for schema design

2. **HIGH**: Begin Phase 2 implementation planning
   - Review PRD requirements for component sync tables
   - Design ComponentsSchema based on real API responses
   - Plan FileComponents sync table architecture

3. **MEDIUM**: Enhance error handling
   - Test error scenarios with invalid team URLs
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly
   - Document edge cases for robust implementation

4. **MEDIUM**: Prepare for core sync table development
   - Review reference implementation patterns
   - Plan pagination strategy for large component sets
   - Design schema evolution approach

## Important Context for Next AI

### Critical information to remember
- OAuth is now fully working with Pack ID 44800, version 4
- Token URL must include `/v1` path: `https://api.figma.com/v1/oauth/token`
- GetConnectionName is confirmed working with live Figma API
- User has confirmed OAuth flow works end-to-end

### Current state summary
- **Where we left off**: Phase 1 MVP complete with working OAuth authentication
- **What's working**: Full OAuth cycle, pack deployment, user authentication
- **What needs attention**: Testing formulas and beginning Phase 2 development

### OAuth Configuration (FINAL)
```typescript
pack.setUserAuthentication({
  type: coda.AuthenticationType.OAuth2,
  authorizationUrl: "https://www.figma.com/oauth",
  tokenUrl: "https://api.figma.com/v1/oauth/token",  // Critical: includes /v1
  scopes: ["file_read"],
  getConnectionName: async function (context) {
    const response = await context.fetcher.fetch({
      method: "GET",
      url: "https://api.figma.com/v1/me",
    });
    return response.body.handle || response.body.email || "Figma User";
  },
});
```

### Success Metrics Achieved
- **OAuth Success Rate**: 100% (working)
- **Pack Deployment**: Successful to Coda (Pack 44800)
- **API Authentication**: Confirmed working with live data
- **User Experience**: Smooth OAuth flow without errors

2. Verified Figma app OAuth configuration was correct
3. Consulted official Figma OAuth documentation
4. Identified missing `/v1` path requirement
5. Applied fix and confirmed resolution

## Success Criteria Met
- ✅ OAuth configuration error resolved
- ✅ TestConnection() ready for live data testing
- ✅ Phase 1 MVP marked as complete (100%)
- ✅ Clear path to Phase 2 development established
